# Assembly Guide (WIP Skeleton)
This doc should go over the basics of how to assemble the 8pack keypad. Order of assembly is important as backtracking  requires knowledge of desoldering.

## Prerequisites
* Basic soldering knowledge and experience (through-hole components, orientation)
* Basic electronics knowledge 

## Plate Assembly (Optional, but must be decided early; assembled first)
For those that plan to add RGB underglow lighting to their keypad using the RGB plate, please follow these steps.

### Step 1 - Attach and solder LED strip to plate

### Step 2 - Attach and solder JST header to plate

## Board assembly
This applies to both the included RGB plate and other 3rd-party cases.

### Step 1 - Attach switches to the plate
With the 8pack logo facing downwards, attach the switches by pushing the keyswitch into the square cutouts. Make sure the keyswitch pins are facing the long edge of the board, and all keyswitches are in the same orientation

### Step 2 - Attach and solder resistors to board
We want these resistors to fit flush with the board, so firstly, bend the resistor pins 90 degrees from the tips of the resistor like so: 

(Pic goes here)

You should end up with a U-shaped component. Next, insert these resistor leads into the holes marked by these labels:

The resistors should be flat against the board. It is also helpful to bend the resistor leads at the through-hole to prevent them from falling out during soldering.

### Step 3 - Attach and solder reset button to board

### Step 4 - Attach and solder male headers to board

### Step 5 
#### IMPORTANT NOTE: Take note of the switch style being used. Check if your switch is a Cherry-style or is a BOX-style switch. Seperate instructions for each style of switch are included.

##### If working with BOX-style switches:

###### Step 5a - Attach and solder LEDs to board

###### Step 5b - Attach and solder keypad switches to board

##### If working with Cherry-style switches

###### Step 5a - Attach and solder keypad switches to board

###### Step 5b - Attach and solder LEDs to board

### Step 6 - Attach and solder Pro Micro to board

### Step 8 - Attach JST Pins to Plate

### Step 8 - Connect the plate to the board using JST cable

### Step 9 - Attach bottom plate
