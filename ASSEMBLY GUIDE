# (WIP) Assembly Guide
This doc should go over the basics of how to assemble the 8pack keypad. Currently a WIP

## Plate Assembly (Optional, but must be decided early)

### Step 1 - Attach and solder LED strip to plate

### Step 2 - Attach and solder JST header to plate

## Board assembly

### Step 1 - Attach switches to the plate

### Step 2 - Attach and solder resistors to board

### Step 3 - Attach and solder reset button to board

### Step 4 - Attach and solder male headers to board

#### IMPORTANT NOTE: If working with BOX-style switches, then steps 5 to 6 are as is. If working with Cherry-style switches, then steps 5 and 6 are swapped.

### Step 5 - Attach and solder LEDs to board

### Step 6 - Attach and solder keypad switches to board

### Step 6 - Attach and solder Pro Micro to board

### Step 7 - Attach JST Pins to Plate

### Step 8 - Connect the plate to the board using JST cable

### Step 9 - Attach bottom plate

## Flashing the firmware (WIP)
