Inspired by [di0ib's Six Pack design](http://www.40percent.club/2017/04/six-pack-10.html), this keypad project is intended for me on learning how to use KiCAD by extending their design to 8 keys. Mishaps, snafus and foobars expected and incoming.

## Features

### PCB
  - 8 keys, directly connected to MCU pins
  - 8 backlight LEDs, individually addresssable
  - Alps or MX button support
  - Runs on a simple Arduino sketch, or optionally QMK firmware

### Plates
  - WS2812 strip underglow support, inspired by [di0db's Gherkin ALPS underglow](http://www.40percent.club/2017/08/gherkin-alps-11.html)
