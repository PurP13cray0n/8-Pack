# 8-Pack
Inspired by di0ib's Six Pack design, this keypad project is intended for me on learning how to use PCB software by extending his  design to 8 keys. Mishaps, snafus and foobars expected and incoming.

#### DO NOT USE THE REV 1.0 PCB, THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN FAULTY
I might have to demote that to an alpha version if anything.
